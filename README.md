func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
    // Called when Spotlight item tapped. Do anything with specified data.
    SpotlightManager.sharedInstance.spotlightItemTapAction(userActivity)
    return true

```

There is a sample function in SpotlightManager that you can simply call. In this project it is called on application launch in **didFinishLaunchingWithOptions** delegate in AppDelegate.swift.
